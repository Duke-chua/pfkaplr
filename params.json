No complicated installation or cryptic console commands needed. \r\n\r\nLiveReload server is patched to allow IE 7,8,9 to connect over Flash-based WebSocket emulation.\r\n\r\nDeveloped with Windows in mind, but works everywhere Python runs. See \"Downloads\" link for \"double-click\"-able package for Windows. Single-click runners for other platforms will come in due time.\r\n\r\nLGPL 2.1"}
