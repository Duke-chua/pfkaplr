Personal Workflow Automation Server

A friendly, intuitive, pretty graphical interface for managing and running tasks common to development workflows:

- Watch folder, 
- notify browser of changes over LiveReload protocol, 
- run shell command as a result of file changes, 
- run a static web server rooted in a particular folder 

These and other tasks can be assembled in semantic chains using easy-to-understand grag-and-drop-based web interface.

It is designed for "double-click" use. No complicated installation or cryptic console commands needed. 

LiveReload server is patched to allow IE 7,8,9 to connect over Flash-based WebSocket emulation.

Developed with Windows in mind, but works everywhere Python runs. "Double-click"-able packages for Windows and Linux are coming very soon.
